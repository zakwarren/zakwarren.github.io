        <p>The most important thing we can do when communicating, whether verbally or through writing, is to say what we mean.</p><p>This is easier said than done, especially when we’re surrounded by jargon within a large business or industry. It gets even worse with management speak (intrinsically facilitate extensible synergy anyone?). We have to remember that the real purpose behind documentation is to get information out of the heads of the creators and into the heads of the users in a way that they can use it. By using plain English we can give our information the highest chance possible of being fully understood. This isn’t dumbing down. It’s the opposite as it takes real thought and skill to do well.</p><p>There are a number of things to think about to improve our writing:</p><ul>
<li>accuracy</li>
<li>clarity</li>
<li>conciseness</li>
<li>tone</li>
<li>tense</li>
<li>grammar, spelling, and terminology</li>
</ul><p>Whenever possible use the active voice over the passive voice. For example, “You can now rejoice at the successful launch of your documentation” is much clearer than “The documentation was successfully launched, and there was much rejoicing”.</p><p>Be concise. This aids understanding and keeps your readers’ attention more easily than long, rambling sentences. You should aim to keep sentences:</p><ul>
<li>15-20 words per sentence in print</li>
<li>10-15 words per sentence online</li>
</ul><p>Think about the attitude of the text towards your audience. Avoid an overly formal tone. Be conversational, be personable, and most of all be human.</p>
