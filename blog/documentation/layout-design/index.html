      <main>
        <p>As well as the content itself, we need to think about the layout and design of the document as a whole. Information can be communicated more easily with a good design than it can with a bad one.</p><h2 id="typography">Typography</h2><p>Typography is what language looks like. The choice of font, its size, and spacing can do a lot to keep a user engaged or to push them away. There are two main types of font, serif and sans serif, and two lesser used types, script and decorative.</p><h3 id="serif">Serif</h3><p>Serif fonts are those with the extra shapes and flourishes on individual letters. The key points to keep in mind with serif fonts are:</p><ul>
<li>best used in printed materials, as the high resolution of print makes it very readable</li>
<li>good for headings</li>
<li>ensure that they have a font size of 12 or more</li>
<li>risks looking amateurish on the web</li>
<li>not liked by all users</li>
</ul><h3 id="sans-serif">Sans Serif</h3><p>Sans serif fonts are those without the extra shapes or flourishes on individual letters. The key points to keep in mind with sans serif fonts are:</p><ul>
<li>best used on the web, as they are readable even on low resolution screens</li>
<li>can be used with most font sizes, including very small</li>
<li>they have a professional, clean look</li>
<li>widely liked by users</li>
</ul><h3 id="script-and-decorative">Script and Decorative</h3><p>These are fonts that can look like handwriting, have very fancy styling, or are otherwise decorative. The key points to keep in mind with script and decorative fonts are:</p><ul>
<li>use in very limited amounts, if at all</li>
<li>not recommended for serious documentation</li>
<li>can hinder legibility</li>
<li>can enhance a design in specific circumstances</li>
</ul><h2 id="fundamental-design-principles">Fundamental Design Principles</h2><p>There are four main design principles that we can use to make our documentation better.</p><h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3><p>Alignment can create strength and cohesion in a design. Text can be aligned:</p><ul>
<li>left</li>
<li>right</li>
<li>centred</li>
</ul><h3 id="proximity">Proximity</h3><p>Proximity implies a relationship or lack thereof. Parts that are closer to each other imply that they are more closely related than those that are far apart.</p><h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3><p>Contrast can be in:</p><ul>
<li>colour</li>
<li>shape</li>
<li>size</li>
</ul><p>It helps information pop and grab the reader’s attention. It’s also good for creating a visual hierarchy.</p><h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3><p>Whitespace is simple, but powerful. It’s a way to draw attention to certain elements and to break up sections so they don’t overwhelm a reader.</p>
