        <p>A requirement captures the user’s need into a plain English description that can then be converted by a developer into a programming language. Poor requirements will lead to project failure, while good requirements will give a much better chance of success.</p><p>Each requirements should be:</p><ul>
<li>unitary and cohesive – address one thing</li>
<li>complete – fully stated in one place with no missing information</li>
<li>consistent – does not contradict any other requirement, and should be fully consistent with all authoritative external documentation</li>
<li>atomic – does not include conjunctions, for example “validate fields A and B” becomes “1. validate field A” and “2. validate field B”</li>
<li>traceable – meets all or part of a business need as stated by stakeholders and is authoritatively documented</li>
<li>current – has not been made obsolete by the passage of time</li>
<li>unambiguous – concisely stated without use of jargon, acronyms, or esoteric verbiage; it should express objective facts and should only be subject to one interpretation</li>
<li>specify importance – defined by stakeholders, time, or budget</li>
<li>verifiable – implementation can be determined through inspection, demonstration, test, or analysis</li>
</ul><p>There are several types of requirements:</p><ul>
<li>business – high level features that describe what will be accomplished for the business and how</li>
<li>user – describe what will be accomplished for the user</li>
<li>functional – define the function of the system or its components, and they describe the behaviours, inputs, and outputs</li>
<li>non-functional – describe quality constraints and non-behavioural requirements, and are often the criteria that define the operating environment in which the functional requirements existing</li>
<li>interface – describes how one system will interact with another system, including hardware and software communication, as well as user interfaces</li>
</ul><p>There are two main styles for writing requirements; traditional and user stories. You will likely have to use the style dictated by the company you work in. However, it is good to understand both styles so you can try to pick the best tool for the job.</p><h2 id="traditional">Traditional</h2><p>These requirements are either written from a user’s perspective or a system’s perspective.</p><h3 id="users-perspective">User’s Perspective</h3><p>The traditional user’s perspective requirements have the following structure:</p><ul>
<li>User type – “The [user class or actor name]…”</li>
<li>Result type - “…shall be able to [do something]…”</li>
<li>Objective - “…[to something].”</li>
<li>Optional qualifier – response time, goal, or quality objective</li>
</ul><p>For example: “The barista shall be able to send an opt-in notification to the customer (within two clicks).”</p><h3 id="systems-perspective">System’s Perspective</h3><p>The traditional system’s perspective requirements have the following structure:</p><ul>
<li>Condition – “When [some conditions are met]…”</li>
<li>Result - “…the system shall [do something].”</li>
<li>Optional qualifier – response time, goal, or quality objective</li>
</ul><p>For example: “When a new notification is saved to the database, the system shall send an SMS message (within thirty seconds).”</p><h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2><p>The more modern user story style of requirements have the following structure: “As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].”</p><p>For example: “As a barista, I want to enrol a customer in the SMS notification system so that they can receive notifications when their orders are ready to collect.”</p><p>This structure helps to remind everyone who the users are and that these are real people with real goals to achieve.</p><p>The requirement will then have a number of acceptance criteria. These help address some of the limitations around incomplete information, or limited information, that a user story can’t implement correctly. In our cafe example, these might look something like this:</p><ul>
<li>“A barista must complete all required fields before submitting the enrolment form”</li>
<li>“Information from the form is stored in the enrolment database”</li>
<li>“A confirmation SMS message is sent to the customer on successful enrolment”</li>
<li>“A cafe manager can view the enrolment status of the customer”</li>
</ul>
