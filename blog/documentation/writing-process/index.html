        <p>Writing documentation follows a similar process to writing code:</p><ol>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Review and edit</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ol><h2 id="plan">Plan</h2><p>There are several important things to think about before placing pen to paper, or finger to keyboard. By spending a little extra time at the start, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble later on.</p><h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3><p>Each document should have a purpose. Ask yourself “Why will the document exist?” and “What is it supposed to accomplish?”. If a document doesn’t have a purpose, it shouldn’t exist.</p><p>The most common purposes for software documentation are:</p><ul>
<li>Requirements – identify what is to be built and to verify that we’re meeting stakeholder expectations</li>
<li>Design / Architecture – defines how the system will be constructed by describing critical components and how they fit together</li>
<li>Code / Technical – enables task completion and a deep understanding of the system</li>
<li>Test Plans / Cases – defines the approach to testing, exposing errors or demonstrating correct behaviour</li>
<li>End-User – enables task completion and provides support and troubleshooting</li>
</ul><h3 id="audience">Audience</h3><p>At every stage of the writing process, we need to be thinking about the audience of the document. Documents written for other developers are going to be very different to those written for end-users. We can think of our audience as the users of the document. We design and build UI that supports users in achieving their aims just as we design and build our documentation to help our audience achieve their aim.</p><p>There are a number of questions we can ask ourselves throughout the writing process to help us focus our writing towards our audience.</p><ul>
<li>Who will be reading it?</li>
<li>What do they already know?</li>
<li>Why are they going to be reading it?</li>
<li>In what environment will they be reading it?</li>
<li>What is their state of mind?</li>
<li>What do they need to know?</li>
<li>What tone is appropriate?</li>
</ul><h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3><p>Deploying software works much better if thought about at the start, and the same is true of documentation. We need to consider the delivery of our documentation early on.</p><h2 id="research">Research</h2><p>Good research gives us a better understanding of the software and so we’ll have a far greater chance of writing successful documentation. There are three main ways to conduct research:</p><ol>
<li>interview subject matter experts (SMEs)</li>
<li>review any existing documentation</li>
<li>use the software</li>
</ol><p>Obviously not all of these options are available at all stages of software development, but they may not all be relevant at each stage of the process.
When writing requirements, there is unlikely to be any existing documentation to read or software to use (although looking at competitors with similar products may be useful). However, there should be some SMEs to interview. These can be the potential future users or other stakeholders.</p><p>Its good to prepare for the SME interview as these are often busy people. Prepare a list of key questions, asking:</p><ul>
<li>who</li>
<li>what</li>
<li>when</li>
<li>where</li>
<li>why</li>
<li>how</li>
</ul><p>Each question should focus on one thing, so you have clear answers, and should be open ended. Yes or no questions aren’t useful here as details are key.</p><p>Remember the SME is a person with their own experiences and opinions. Anticipate possible directions of the interview and think about your response. Consider how you’ll get the interview back on track if it derails.</p><h2 id="write">Write</h2><p>This is the part where it all comes together. Many people find this the most difficult part, but it doesn’t have to be. This is especially true if you have prepared and have a good understanding of what it is you’re writing about.</p><p>Think about how best to organise your content and ideas. This will be dependant on the content of the documentation and the audience it is aimed at. A few common ways include:</p><ul>
<li>chronological</li>
<li>parts of an object</li>
<li>simple to complex</li>
<li>specific to general</li>
</ul><p>Write you first draft. Your blank page will soon be filled with your ideas. This can be a daunting step, but remember that it is only a first draft. It doesn’t matter how well written or otherwise it is, only that you’ve made a start.</p><p>Next review and revise your draft. This is different to the formal review and edit stage and the first draft doesn’t even need to be completed to begin this task. Though be wary of falling into the trap of reviewing and revising so much that you never complete that first draft.</p><p>There are a number of questions you can ask yourself:</p><ul>
<li>Does the document fulfil its purpose?</li>
<li>Is anything missing?</li>
<li>Can anything be taken out?</li>
<li>What questions will the reader have? (Don’t forget to answer them!)</li>
<li>Is the writing easy to understand?</li>
</ul><h2 id="review-and-edit">Review and Edit</h2><p>This is where you adjust and reorganise your content. It is best to have somebody else review your document as they’ll be able to spot things that you may otherwise have missed.
This is also the step where you will edit for style, grammar and punctuation.</p><p>You may also review to incorporate any test results. Usability testing can play an important and useful role in ensuring your documentation is the best it can be. This is especially pertinent when the documentation is for the users of the software. Usability testing should be line-by-line testing of a document to ensure it makes sense and the instruction work as expected.</p><h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2><p>This stage is the equivalent of deploying your application and, in many cases, will be the deployed at the same time as your software. This is why it is important to ensure you coordinate with the development team and other writers to release. You should create a plan for updates.</p><p>This is where you will bundle up all your final documents, such as readme files, web pages, or PDFs. It’s also where you would handle any translations, if applicable.
You can now rejoice at the successful launch of your documentation!</p>
