        <p>End-user documentation may be the most important type of documentation that you’ll create with a software project. It’s aimed at teaching the users how to use the software and to help them if they get stuck.</p><h2 id="user-guide">User Guide</h2><p>This helps the user to understand and use a system. It has several key sections:</p><h3 id="overview">Overview</h3><p>This often follows a table of contents. It’s a high level description of the product and describes it’s major features, the benefits a user gets from using the software, and, if applicable, how it fits in with other products.</p><h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3><p>This is where you should describe the setup and configuration information. It’s best to do this in a task-based style, so that the user can start using the system quickly. It’s also a good place to list the prerequisites for using the system.</p><h3 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h3><p>This should be organised by main features or tasks.</p><h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3><p>This section details possible errors or problems, and describes how to resolve them.</p><h3 id="frequently-asked-questions-faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3><p>This section can list common questions that users have, along with answers and references to additional information.</p><h3 id="support">Support</h3><p>This section should detail how to get additional help and the contact information for any support desks.</p><h3 id="glossary-and-index">Glossary and Index</h3><p>These are the final sections and only need to be included if relevant.</p><h2 id="quick-reference-guide">Quick Reference Guide</h2><p>The quick reference guide should distil the key information from the user guide into a short, easy to understand document. It can even be a single page.</p><p>You shouldn’t use walls of text in the quick reference guide. Instead, you can include:</p><ul>
<li>diagrams</li>
<li>reference tables</li>
<li>steps</li>
<li>graphics</li>
<li>infographics</li>
</ul><h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2><p>Release notes document the differences between two versions of the same software, such as v1 and v2. It should describe:</p><ul>
<li>release date</li>
<li>product versions</li>
<li>previous product version</li>
<li>the benefits of upgrading</li>
<li>new, cool features</li>
<li>bug fixes</li>
</ul><h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3><p>This should list the new features or functionality in this release, and describe the benefits of the new features.</p><h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3><p>This should list changes to existing features, include the justification for the change, and describe how the change is beneficial.</p><h3 id="resolved-issues">Resolved Issues</h3><p>This should detail any problems that existed in the previous release that were fixed in this release. It should include a brief description of the solution to the issue.</p><h3 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h3><p>This should list any bugs that are known to exist when the software releases. This lets the client determine if they will be an issue for them. It establishes credibility, but make sure that they are resolved in the next release.</p><h3 id="frequently-asked-questions-faqs-1">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3><p>This should include common or anticipated user questions and their answers.</p><h3 id="optional-sections">Optional Sections</h3><p>You could include the system requirements and installation instructions in the release notes, but only if these have changed since the last release.</p>
