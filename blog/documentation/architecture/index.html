        <p>This is usually known as the Software Design Document (SDD). It’s a written description of a software product that gives a development team overall guidance to the architecture of the software project. It should have the following key sections:</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>This is the first section, though is often behind a table of contents. It summarizes the document and should contain the following information:</p><ul>
<li>purposes</li>
<li>scope</li>
<li>intended audience</li>
<li>design goals and rationale</li>
<li>definitions of important terms or reference glossary</li>
<li>assumptions and dependencies (such as being able to send and receive texts)</li>
<li>constraints (such as must work on Windows 7)</li>
<li>goals and guidelines</li>
<li>development methods (such as the MVC pattern for high cohesion and low coupling)</li>
</ul><h2 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h2><p>This is a high level overview of functionality and responsibilities of the system. It should describe high level components and how they work together. It doesn’t have to only contain descriptive text, it could include diagrams, flowcharts, models, scenarios, and high level use cases showing system behaviour and structure.</p><h2 id="detailed-system-design">Detailed System Design</h2><p>This section should describe in detail the functionality and responsibilities for each component of the system. It often uses class and sequence diagrams to show relationships and flows. It can include:</p><ul>
<li>design patterns and techniques</li>
<li>modules, classes, files, etc.</li>
<li>data structures</li>
<li>algorithms</li>
<li>interfaces</li>
</ul><h2 id="data-design">Data Design</h2><p>This describes the data structures, databases, and storage units and their relationships. This section will often contain an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to show these structures and relationships. This section can include:</p><ul>
<li>frequency of updates</li>
<li>security requirements</li>
<li>recovery</li>
<li>report generation</li>
<li>interfacing systems</li>
</ul><h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2><p>This section describes the functionality from the user’s perspective. It will often include wireframes or mock-ups of what the UI will look like. It describes the controls and their behaviours, as well as supported orientations and dimensions.</p><h2 id="glossary--appendix">Glossary / Appendix</h2><p>These are the final sections and only need to be included if relevant.</p>
