    Leadership is a big responsibility. We go from roles that revolve around
    technology, to a role that is primarily concerned with social skills.
    However, there are similarities; we still care about finding the optimal
    solution to a problem. It's just that this problem is making the team the
    best it can be.
  </p><p>
    As well as the potential prestige, power, and pay rise, we're now
    responsible for a group of people. We can't control them as we can control
    software, nor should we try. People work best when trusted to do their job
    as they understand it. This can be a big change for developers moving up to
    leadership position, and it's easy to get wrong and begin micromanaging.
  </p><p>
    However, if we use our skills of learning and problem solving, we can become
    great leaders. This series contains some of my thoughts, observations and
    experiences on leadership.
