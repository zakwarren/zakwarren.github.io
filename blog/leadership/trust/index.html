        <p>Early on in my leadership career I was given a profound piece of advice: “Allow team members to do things their own way”. It wasn’t until recently that I really appreciated it.</p><p>I’d been asked to assist with a project due to my experience building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). It was a spin off project from a big system, with the aim of providing a fresh front end that could be installed on phones and have offline capabilities. The architect and lead developer on the project introduced himself and talked me through the goal of the project, the context of the parent system, and what he’d done so far.</p><p>While he was a very experienced C# developer and had been working on the parent project for over 30 years, he admitted he was pretty new to modern front end tools like React and PWAs. I assured him that wasn’t a problem, and I was keen to offer what insight I could, as I had a few years of experience in these technologies at this point.
I began by setting up a prettier config file based off the project’s style guide, which was readily received by the other developers. The service worker I developer was also happily incorporated into the project.</p><p>Things changed when I was assigned tickets that involved adding to, and editing, the architect’s existing React code. Every pull request has comments beginning with “This code is great, but…”, followed by large rewrites of my code. When I challenged him on these, his only explanation was that his way was best practice. I found it even more frustrating as many of these changes resulted in code that was definitely not best practice.</p><p>There came a point when I noticed a serious bug in one of the files. I found myself thinking that someone else would pick that up and fix it, but I’m not going to do it. I caught myself and realised that wasn’t the real me thinking that, it was what the culture of the project had instilled in me. I fixed it and included it in my next pull request. Sure enough, the architect rewrote my solution.</p><p>I checked out a couple of pull requests from the two junior developers on the project and found that the architect was doing the exact same thing with them. I found it a relief that I wasn’t the only one being targeted. As the leader of the project, and someone who’d worked on the parent project for so many decades, the architect was finding it difficult to give up control. This was seriously slowing down the project.</p><p>I found my work was slowing down, as I was demotivated by the project and always second guessing how the architect would do it. In the end I asked my manager for different work. Fortunately he listened to my concerns and moved me to a different project.</p><p>I’ve made a point, in every project I’ve led, to ensure I give my team the space to do their job as they understand it as this is how I want to be treated. I’ve made a more conscious effort to do this after this particular experience. This approach doesn’t mean quality is sacrificed or code standards slipped, but does mean I have to accept others may not solve problems in the way I would do it. This is a good thing, as often people find better, more creating solutions than I could if I did the whole thing myself.</p><p>Learn to trust your team and, more often than not, that trust will be rewarded.</p>
