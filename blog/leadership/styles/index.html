        <p>There’s a classic image in leadership textbooks and training materials that shows a group of people dragging a stone as in ancient Egypt to build the pyramids. Some of the people are labelled with different leadership styles. This is usually followed by the question: “Which one are you?”.</p><p>I had a colleague who liked to regularly refer to this image. He would point to the person at the front of the team dragging the stone and proudly assert that this was him. I would try to refuse answering when he’d ask which I thought I was. Occasionally I’d give in and say I was all of them. He’d tell me I couldn’t be all of them, I could only be one.</p><p>My colleague was probably right in some ways though, as I spend most of my time as one or two of those leadership archetypes. In this sense I’m a guide, giving my team plenty of space to do their thing, but promoting conversations and providing support when needed.</p><p>However, I believe that flexibility is one of the key attributes of a good leader. There are times when you have to be more authoritarian and make snap decisions. There are also times when a following style in more appropriate.</p><h2 id="a-practical-take">A Practical Take</h2><p>You may have noticed that the three styles I’ve described above aren’t the same terms as used in the diagram. I find that the styles in the diagram are very academic. They have their place, but I like something more practical and easy to apply.</p><p>The three styles I described are the three main points on a continuum. This goes from authoritarian on one end, to following at the other, with guiding in the middle. It’s a practical tool that I learnt from sports coaching, which has a lot of similarities with leadership.</p><p>With an authoritarian style, all attention is on you and you’re the one issuing information and instructions. This is often a good position to take in an emergency as there often isn’t time to build consensus. It’s also good for solving simple problems, organising events, or when directly asked for advice.</p><p>A following style is often tricky to get right as it means you lose control for a short time. The attention is on the team member and it’s about listening to them. This is a great style to use when a team member is an expert, as you give them the chance to take the lead. I find this style particularly useful in heated discussions. Let the person say their piece. You don’t have to agree, but you should show your understanding with a brief summary of what has been discussed so far. Keep it brief and relevant. When you show you understand, people very quickly calm down.</p><p>The guiding style is the central point on the continuum. I find it the ideal style for software development teams as it’s most effective when working together to try to solve complex problems. It involves a lot of trust, which I believe is another key attribute of a good leader. You can point team members in the right direction, providing support and advice when needed, and creating the opportunities to figure things out for themselves.</p><p>Ultimately, it’s about good, open conversations.</p>
