        <p>It’s an essential skill for leaders to be able to give feedback effectively. Whether it’s praise, bad news, or constructive, feedback takes skill to give well. We can learn a lot about giving feedback from other fields. My own skills were developed through a mix of mentoring junior developers, leadership, and particularly sports coaching.
Whatever sort of feedback you want to give, make sure that you build rapport with the person first. A good relationship helps the person accept the feedback and make use of it.</p><h2 id="praise">Praise</h2><p>There’s a careful balance to be struck with praise. It’s far too easy to use it too much and then it becomes meaningless. It’s probably better to use praise too little than too much, so when it is used it is more meaningful to the recipient.</p><p>Crafting effective praise is also a tricky skill to master. I’ve found that an effective piece of praise is more than a simple “well done”. If not overused, this phrase might give the recipient a feeling of pleasure or pride, but it will be brief. A well crafted piece of praise should be long lasting in it’s effect and encourage the recipient to behave this way more often.</p><p>I gauge the praise that I craft against two coaches that I’ve worked with, both operate at opposite extremes when it come to delivering praise.</p><p>The first coach used simple phrases like “well done” and “good work” in almost every sentence. His students didn’t respond in any way to these phrases, as they heard them so often.</p><p>The second coach didn’t use praise very often, but always seemed to know when it was most effective to use it. She would use more personally crafted pieces of praise, such as “you showed quick reflexes there” and “good eye for spotting that line”. Her students responded well to this and they all aimed to repeat, and build on, the skills she praised.</p><p>I aim to be more like the second coach, though know I haven’t yet mastered it. I’ve got better with practice and noticed the results very quickly.</p><p>I was pair programming with a placement student on one of our projects. He’d found a great use for an algorithm to traverse a non-binary tree. He’d learnt it in his previous year at university, but never applied it. He’d done well at implementing it, just needed some help fixing a couple of issues with integrating it properly. I knew this was the perfect time to deliver some good quality praise. I said “that was a clever use of that algorithm, nice work”. He was genuinely pleased and has since found several other places where code could be made more efficient.</p><h2 id="bad-news">Bad News</h2><p>If you’ve been a leader for any length of time, then it’s likely you’ve had to give bad news. It’s never an easy thing to do, nor should it be. But there are a few things we can do to make it easier.</p><p>Get to the point quickly. It’s good to build rapport a little before giving feedback, but don’t spend more than a sentence or two in this instance. Usually bad news is not unexpected.</p><p>Have empathy, but don’t talk about how bad it makes you feel to give this news. It’s a horrible thing to have to do. But however bad you feel, you can be sure that they feel worse.</p><p>Ask before you give any advice. They need to be receptive to receiving advice, otherwise they’ll push back or ignore it completely.</p><p>Give them time and space to process the news. Ensure there is time afterwards; this shouldn’t be immediately before another meeting. Allow them space; it’s very awkward to go back to their desk if sat next to you or other manager.</p><h2 id="constructive-feedback">Constructive feedback</h2><p>The most common framework for giving constructive feedback is the feedback sandwich. This is where you would say something positive, say something constructive, then say something positive again. The idea is that this makes something constructive easier to stomach. However, this is so pervasive that people don’t hear the first positive thing as they’re waiting for what you really want to say. They then ignore the last positive thing as they’re too busy thinking about the constructive feedback.</p><p>Fortunately, there is an easy way to give constructive feedback: ask them! We’ve all experienced teachers or leaders trying to impart information onto us forcefully. Our immediate reaction is usually to resist it or shrug it off. We’re not receptive.</p><p>I originally learnt this technique from sports coaching, but I’ve found it just as effective with development teams. It has three steps:</p><ol>
<li>ask</li>
<li>provide feedback</li>
<li>ask</li>
</ol><p>You might begin by asking “Is it OK if we talk about what you’re working on?” or perhaps more directly “Would you be open to some feedback on that block of code?”. This seems to help people become more open to feedback. They feel like an equal part of the process.</p><p>Next you can provide the feedback. It’s best to do this is small pieces, so the person can properly process and apply it. The skill is to find that one piece of feedback that will make the biggest difference to them and only deliver this. With practice you can find one thing that will indirectly improve lots of things.</p><p>Keep it positive. Avoid phrases like “you must do…” or “this should be done like…”, as I’ve found that elicits immediate pushback or defensive behaviours. Phrase it so its their choice, such as “why not try…” or “how about…”, as it seems to get much better uptake.</p><p>I’ll often finish this technique with asking another question, such as “how about that?” or “what do you think?”. This keeps the person engaged and gets them thinking about it more.</p>
