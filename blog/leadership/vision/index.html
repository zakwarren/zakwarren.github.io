        <p>I’m a big fan of speaking and writing in plain English. That is to “say what you mean”. All industries have their jargon and its use is meaningful in the right context. However, with this jargon comes the risk of language becoming incomprehensible or even meaningless. Management speak is the most famous example of this.</p><p>Hidden among all the management speak and training guides there are a couple of useful words. One of those is “vision”. It does have meaning and the dictionary describes it as “the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom”. In terms of leadership, we can think of vision as the desired state of our team. I’ve yet to find a better term for this meaning.</p><p>Vision is a tricky thing to get right and apply. Ideally we want the team to create their own vision as then they are much more likely to embrace it and work towards it. Don’t forget that you’re part of the team too, so allow yourself the opportunity to add your thoughts. However, you’re in a position of power, so choose your words and timing carefully. What you say may unduly influence what the rest of the team says afterwards.</p><p>A good vision, embraced by the team, is a powerful thing. It will change the way the team works together, spread to new team members, and may even spread to other teams. It can stick around when the original team members are gone and replaced by new people. If the vision wasn’t quite right, or circumstances change radically, then you may have to bring the team together to create a new one at some stage.</p><p>The best vision I’ve been a part of creating wasn’t actually in business, but when I led a Scout Troop. I’ve occasionally had managers that have looked down their noses at leadership experience in youth groups or sports. However, the best managers understand that the skills we learn in one aspect of life are easily transferred to other aspects. In many cases this diversity of experience makes us better than we could otherwise be.</p><h2 id="creating-a-vision">Creating a Vision</h2><p>When I was asked to become the Scout leader for my local troop, I was nervous thinking about the burden of responsibility. I had the opportunity to build on what had come before, but also start afresh. I began by asking a very open ended question: “What skills would you like to learn in Scouts?”. There was silence at first. They weren’t used to being asked their thoughts and feelings about a topic. Slowly, tentatively, a few hands went up. I asked a couple to share their thoughts. Gradually more hands went up. I then sent the Scouts away in pairs to talk about it.</p><p>When they all returned I let each pair speak in turn. I also said what I’d like to learn and asked the same of the two assistant leaders in the troop. I then sent them all away in their pairs again to answer the question: “What do you think a Scout should be able to do by the time they’re old enough to move up?”. After giving them time to talk in their pairs, I called them back and asked for their responses.</p><p>Both of these questions promoted a lot of discussion and I made sure I gave them time to talk in their pairs and as the whole group. This provided a lot of interesting information about what they thought about the current state of the troop and what they wanted. Even the other two adults engaged in the conversation.</p><p>At the end of the session we’d pulled together three common goals, which gave us our vision. These were:</p><ol>
<li>have fun</li>
<li>learn new skills</li>
<li>be youth shaped</li>
</ol><p>Alongside this vision, I also had a long list of skills and activities that the Scouts wished to do. These ranged from cooking to canoeing expeditions. I now knew that if these activities, and any others that we ran, met these three goals then we were doing it right.</p><p>This whole process took about half an hour. It may take less time if the team is already used to the idea of being able to talk openly like this.</p><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>If you are new to a team member led approach, it can be daunting. It goes against the traditional view of a boss who sits around telling people what to do. We’re trained from an early age to just do what people in authority say, from parents, to teachers, to bosses. People often aspire to be in that position of telling people what to do. But people work best when they’re free to figure out their own ways of doing things, make their own mistakes and learn from them, and are trusted to do good work. Good leadership, strong leadership, is about trusting your team and building consensus.</p><p>It’s important to ensure everyone has a say, even in short meetings. A popular technique in schools and youth groups is to go round and give everyone the opportunity, one at a time. This technique is not just for children, it’s equally applicable to adults. It comes from the Zulu meeting style known as indaba. Encourage everyone to take up the opportunity, but don’t force it. Leaders might use a physical item to represent someone’s time to talk, especially with children.</p><p>Ask open questions. These are questions that can have any answer, the more detailed the better, rather than a simple yes or no. Open questions are great at sparking conversation. If the conversation dies down, or gets diverted, you can help it along with short summaries of what has been discussed so far. Keep it brief, positive, and relevant. Encourage people to share their thoughts and feelings. If needed, ask another open question.</p><p>Ensure everyone is treated with respect, as this will enable people to open up more.</p><p>Find practical goals or criteria that describe your vision. Remember it’s the desired state of your team, so having a practical things that you can test against is key.</p><h2 id="applying-a-vision">Applying a Vision</h2><p>This is far easier if the team have created their own vision, but can be done if a vision is imposed from above. It’s about ensuring every decision you make fits in with the vision. It needs to be more than a slogan on a poster.</p><p>Within a couple of weeks, most of my scout troop had forgotten the goals we’d set. I suspected this would happen and didn’t let it put me off. It was a long journey, not a quick task.</p><p>For my own, and my assistant leaders’, benefit, I wrote the vision in a note widget on the homepage of our record system. I could then use it as a checklist when organising activities. When new adults joined the team, I occasionally had requests to add arbitrary activities to the list, or to remove the list entirely and use it for something else. However, it was one of the couple of things I stood firm on. With time and understanding came acceptance, or perhaps just tolerance.</p><p>For every activity that we organised, I made sure that it met our goals. At first, it only had to be the first and the others were a bonus. As the months went by, I started insisting that activities met two of our goals. Within a year I was insisting that it three of the goals had to be met. Within eighteen months I no longer had to insist; it had become habit for both adults and Scouts.</p><p>Once it was ingrained, we became more lenient on individual activities. For example, a game might only tick two (fun and youth shaped, for example) as long as the whole evening met all three goals.</p><p>It was at this point, when I asked the Scouts what they thought of the troop, that they’d describe it as our vision. They’d use their own words, but the meaning was the same. This was a great moment for me personally, but also for the troop, and was a significant contributing factor in the troop’s growth to double the number of Scouts and to around 10 adult volunteers. This brought me new challenges in leading the troop, but these were good challenges to have.</p><h3 id="tips-1">Tips</h3><p>Reminders about the vision are useful, such as the note on our record system. However, words need to be backed up by action.</p><p>Activities were a natural unit to apply the goals of the vision in my Scout troop. In a technical team, you may find it best to work with projects or sprints instead. Find whatever works best for you and your team.</p><p>Apply the goals gradually and you’ll find they’re naturally incorporated by the team. The transition from the starting state to the desired state in my Scout troop was gradual. We had three goals or criteria that made up the vision and I began by making sure each activity met the first goal, otherwise we changed the plan or didn’t do it at all. Once this was embedded, I could apply the second, and so on. This technique has served me well in technical teams as well. While we didn’t necessarily have the ability to drop projects, we could do our best to adjust the plan and our approach to suit our vision.</p><p>Be patient. Applying a vision takes time, especially in long established teams. When a team can create its own vision, it’s far easier and quicker to apply.</p>
