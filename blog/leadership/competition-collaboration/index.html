        <p>Both competition and collaboration are useful tools in your toolbox as a leader. My personal favourite is collaboration as I believe it’s a far more powerful thing when done right. Humans are social creatures and prefer to form groups. This has been to our great success throughout history. We wouldn’t have the society we have today without working together. As a developer, I rely on the food supply chain, electricity, the hardware I work on, among many other things that are provided by other people in other teams.</p><p>Competition, at the right time and in the right doses, can be a great incentive. A good friend of mine works on an IT helpdesk team and is proud of the fact that his team is consistently at the top of the company’s helpdesk leader board. He’s also always at, or near, the top of his team’s leader board. There’s no reward, aside from pride, at being at the top and no big deal is made of it. Crucially, there’s no penalty for being at the bottom. It’s just there in the background. This makes it a strangely powerful motivator. However, it’s a delicate balance, as too much competition can lead to resentment, tribalism, and a toxic environment.</p><p>After a few years into my leadership career, I was exploring the balance between competition and collaboration. I had a colleague who strongly believed in competition. He led a different, closely related team and would often put down other teams at every opportunity, and this attitude gradually permeated through much of his team. I’d be naive to think that this competitive nature didn’t spread a little, and we likely played into it a bit subconsciously at least.</p><p>Despite this, my team and I made a conscious decision to be more open and collaborative. This was an experiment for me at this point in my career, but it turned into an eye opening one that has had a profound impact on my approach. We actively sought out opportunities to work with other teams and we quickly saw the benefit. My team, and those we worked with, grew more and did better things than we could have alone.</p><p>I even reached out to my competitive colleague. I had a project that would benefit by some of the expertise of his team, and I knew he had a project that could benefit from my team’s skills. Sadly, his response was an immediate “no”. However, my team didn’t let this attitude get us down and we reached out to other teams who we had worked with before. They were much more receptive and we all ended up learning a lot and delivering a successful project, even going further than we originally believed was possible.</p><p>This approach also grew a much more positive and respectful culture within my team, and between my team and those we engaged with. This showed with more people knowing each other well, saying hello, and even forming close friendships. It contrasted sharply with our interactions with the closely related team, which often involved receiving constant little snipes and belittlement. Fortunately, the other teams provided a wide support network and allowed us to minimize contact with the closely related team.</p><p>I don’t believe that competition is inherently bad, but it can be a double-edged sword. It’s application needs to be thought about carefully. If applied well it can lead to good results in a short time. Good collaboration can be a much stronger force and lead to amazing things, but it takes time and effort to grow and maintain.</p>
