        <p>For most of my career I’ve worked in an agile way, whether I
realised it or not at the time. The techniques of iterating through work,
collaborating with others, and getting feedback from users, customers,
and our tests are so fundamental to software development that I’d not
really thought much about it. These were just things we did if we
wanted to produce good quality software that’s actually useful to people,
and in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>I first heard the term “Agile” in one of my first jobs. It was a big
department and one day several middle managers returned from a course
and were fired up with enthusiasm for this amazing methodology they’d
just learnt about. The course they’d been on was defininitely about
“Agile” with a capital “A”. It came with all these fancy rituals and
a whole book’s worth of jargon and they loved it.</p><p>Aside from standing up for meetings and calling each two week period a
“sprint”, nothing changed in how we worked. Looking back, we already
worked in small steps, iterating back over things, and collaborated
closely across teams. This didn’t change with the addition of
scrum-style agile practices. But neither were customers brought in to
give feedback. I’m not sure what the managers’ aims were or if it was
just about joining in on the latest trend. Either way, it seemed to
miss the point.</p><p>A few jobs later I found myself as the lead developer in a small,
in-house dev team. We created and maintained the applications used by
the all the other staff in the company. My manager was the director
but had no knowledge of IT or software. Fortunately he trusted me to
get the work done and left me to it. Over the time I worked there,
we naturally fell into good development habits. We broke tasks down
into small, manageable chunks, iterated over work, constantly improving
our code in small steps, and worked closely with our users. These
techniques all helped to make sure our apps were as useful and
user-friendly as possible. Our proximity to IT operations also meant
that we could recover from downtime or unexpected issues far faster
than we could otherwise.</p><p>Looking back, despite not being aware that this was what the cool
kids called agile, this was the time when the way I worked was
at it’s best. A good environment, enabling good ways of working, can
allow developers to make much higher quality software in less time
than otherwise.</p><p>More recently I’m working in a big company, as part of a big team.
When I began working for the company, they worked in a highly agile
way, both in philosophy and with the corporate rituals and jargon.
They even sent me on a week’s course when I joined to ensure I
could work in the same way as everyone else and was familiar with
the jargon. With several restructures and the expansion of every
team, this has been lost.</p><p>On my latest project, I’m leading the frontend development of a large,
complex, and high priority app. Right from the start, the project
managers were very insistant that this project, and all new projects,
are being run with a waterfall approach. This led to raised eyebrows
and a lot of questions and attempts at persuasion from developers,
testers, business analysts, and others working on the project. All
were met with increasingly forceful insistence that this is the only
way we were allowed to work.</p><p>Unfamiliar as we are with working in such an old-fashioned and
ineffective way, we have found it difficult to give up our good
practices. Some developers have received harsh words for talking
about constant feedback from automated tests, going back to improve
code, refining requirements and designs as we learn more, and asking
for user feedback. Everyone worked as hard and as well as they could
considering the situation but, unsurprisingly, the waterfall projects
suffered from all the stereotypical issues. Delays, more bugs than
we’d expect, a design we’re less confident in, less governance, and
a slow path to deployment.</p><p>While my experience is anecdotal, <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/">The State of DevOps</a>
report takes a scientific approach. The authors surveyed thousands
of software teams from a variety of companies of different sizes
across different industries. They found that those companies that
embrace an agile philosophy were far more effective, producing higher
quality software with fewer bugs and higher governance at a far faster
rate. Big companies like Netflix can deploy thousands of times a day!
Teams that practice agile development deploy 200 times more than those
that don’t. In the future we may find ways that are better than the
agile approach, but for now it’s been shown to be the most effective
way to build good software.</p>
