        <p>One of the great joys of software development is that there
is always so much to learn. You have to be a life-long learner
to be a good software developer. Technologies move on. Some
disappear altogether. New things arrive that users and
businesses want.</p><p>The vast majority of software developers I know are avid
learners. I’m the same. Learning new things is fun, a
compulsion even. We get a rush when we finally figure
something out and all our studies come together for us.</p><p>For some, it can be daunting. They want a stable job
where they know what they’re getting each day, work at
it for a few decades, then retire. New things and change
can be scary.</p><p>At the end of last year I worked on a spin off app to one
of the company’s oldest products. The lead developer on it
had been working on this product with the same couple of
developers for about thirty years. I found the code hard to
read, the architecture arcane and archaic, and the idea of
working on the same thing in the same way for so long so
strange and hard to comprehend. This project was decreasingly
relevant to the business due to this resistance to adapt,
it, and the associated way of working was comforting for them.</p><p>Learning is also a skill, and one we’re not taught to do
particularly well. I spend a lot of time these days training
and mentoring placement students and junior developers. I
spend a lot of time when new juniors join guiding them to find
out how they best learn and teaching them skills to help them
learn better. One of my catchphrases seems to have become
“Your main job as a junior developer is to learn as much as
you can”.</p><p>The act of developing software is primarily the task of
learning what it is you’re going to create and what is most
useful for the users. If the project is anything more than
the smallest, most simple piece of software, then no one
knows exactly what it is they want made when you start. This
is why working in a way that is optimised for learning is
so important.</p><p>So how do we do that? We need feedback. We need it regularly
and as early as possible.</p>
