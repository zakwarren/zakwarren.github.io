  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a highly skilled and experienced full stack software developer. The
    chart shows my main skills but I'm a quick and efficient learner, and a firm
    believer in using the best tool for the job. During my career I've made use
    of a variety of other technologies, based on business need, project
    requirements, what my colleagues have skills in, and what is available at
    the time. A few examples of these include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linux Servers and Bash</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Powershell</li>
    <li>SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)</li>
    <li>WebFOCUS</li>
  </ul>
