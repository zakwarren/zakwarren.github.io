I'd spent a few years focusing on back end development for both
work and personal projects. I'd let my front end skills get rusty
and lost track of some of the latest features of web technologies.
With a change in circumstances, my interest in front end development
was reignited.

To tune up my skills and play with some of the new features of HTML5
and CSS3, I decided to make a few mock up websites for various
different things that interest me in life. I love getting outside
and taking part in adventurous activities, so a website for an
activities club was a perfect fit.

I kept it general so I could focus on the "how" of making it as
opposed to getting bogged down in specific design decisions for a
niche club. This also meant I could use it as a template for future
web projects if I did want to create something more niche. There's
a lot to be said for having reusable code.

In this instance, I was particularly interested in experimenting
with viewport units, flexbox and grids. I was pleased with the
result, as it was a much easier process to get something properly
responsive compared with some of my previous projects.
